# Baby's first WASM compilation

I spun this up with `bun`, you can use `npm` instead for all these commands if you don't want to install bun. If you do, `brew install oven-sh/bun/bun` 

## See it in action:
`bun install`

`bun run dev`

## Compile it yourself:
`bun install -g assemblyscript`

`rm public/hello-world.wasm`

`bun run compile-wasm`
